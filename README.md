# Real-time-Drone-Tracking-with-CSRT


The project uses the OpenCV library to implement object tracking using the CSRT algorithm. It captures video input from a file or webcam, allowing the user to select an object to track by drawing a bounding box around it. The CSRT tracker then continuously updates the position of the object in each frame, drawing a green rectangle around it. Pressing 'e' quits the tracking. This project is a simple but effective way to perform real-time object tracking in videos or camera feeds.
